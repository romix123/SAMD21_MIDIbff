# SAMD21_MIDIbff
 USB midi <-> TRS-b converter

I came across todbot's qtpy_midibff and thought I can share my attempt to design a USB <-> TRS-b converter as well, so here it is.

The board has the same footprint (and should be pin compatible) with the Wemos D1 mini board, making it a versatile little board. It comes with TRS-b midi in/out, a USB host port, a micro USB port for powering the board and a WS2812 (neopixel). The firmware is very rudimentary and not thoroughly tested.
